# Paycrest Protocol
A P2P powered crypto-to-cash exchange protocol.

This is a work in progress. Follow [this guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/) if you want to contribute to this README.

## What is Paycrest Protocol?

## Architecture

## Development Setup
To set up your development environment for Paycrest Protocol, follow these steps:

1. Setup Paycrest Protocol repo in your local machine.
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/paycrest/protocol.git
cd protocol

# copy and update enviroment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Start the development environment:

**With Docker**
```bash
# build the image
docker-compose build

# run containers
docker-compose up -d
```

*OR*

**Without docker**
*(Ensure you have PostgreSQL 13 or higher installed and running with a database created and the credentials updated in the .env file.)*

```bash
# Tap brew core repository. Might take some time.
brew tap homebrew/core

# Install PostgreSQL via homebrew
brew install postgresql

# start postgresql service
brew services start postgresql

# Install Redis via homebrew
brew install redis

# start redis service
brew services start redis
```


Setup database


```bash
createdb paycrest
createuser postgres

# connect to paycrest database
psql paycrest

# enable extended display
\x

```
install Atlas ent
```bash
curl -sSf https://atlasgo.sh | sh
```

run migrations
```bash
atlas migrate apply   --dir "file://ent/migrate/migrations"  --url "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/test?search_path=public&sslmode=disable"
```

Setup redis

```bash
# Run redis on the current TTY
redis-server

# connect to redis instance
redis-cli

# set new password
CONFIG SET requirepass "password"
```

```bash
# install go dependencies
go mod download

# install Air for live reloading
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosmtrek/air/master/install.sh | sh -s

# Or 

go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest

# start server
air
```

That's it! The server will now be running at http://localhost:8000. You can use an API testing tool like Postman or cURL to interact with the API.

**Seed database**
```bash
# run seed-db script
go run scripts/seed/main.go
```

## Usage
TODO: Add API documentation.
